This repository contains a collection of chemical engineering-related projects, models, and simulations.

## Project Breakdown:

### 1. CSTR_Lyapunov:

*   **Description:** This directory contains code and analysis related to the stability of a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR) using Lyapunov's direct method. Code is written in Python and leverages the library for matrix operations. The analysis focuses on determining the stability region of a linearized CSTR model by verifying the negative definiteness of the Lyapunov equation.
*   **Key Files:**
    *   `Python source code implementing the Lyapunov stability check.
*   **Status:** The project is functional in carrying out a core task (but may need better implementation of custom Tensor Flow Layer in code.
    *   *For code which works, the project has the ability to demonstrate the principles, which is a step further than what was seen to the code.*

### 2. CSTR_optimize:

*   **Description:** This project involves the optimization of a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR) system. Details include reaction rates, activation energy and reactor parameters.
*   **Potential Tasks:**
    *   The CSTR optimization is done using newton method, gradient descent and polynomial regerssion.

### 3. Kinetic_Modelling:

*   **Description:** This project is focused on replication of paper on kinetic modelling of lactic acid production


### 4. QMOM_PINN:

*   **Description:** This directory contains code for a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) implementation for solving the Quadrature Method of Moments (QMOM) equations related to particle systems. The code uses TensorFlow/Keras.
*   **Key Files:**
    *   `PINN.py`: Python script defining and training the PINN model.
         XGB.py :  Python script for implementation of XGBoost for data based optimization using only data analysis
*   **Status:** this project is still under development.Simpler version is up and running.The goal is to create a model that respects physical laws to make accurate predictions.
* *The most stable, functional code must always be made available first.*

### 5. ZLD

*   **Description**: The ZLD plant modelling which uses RO + MVR setup.


### 6. buoyancyFlow

*   **Description**: This is a valuable tool for representing that you can use fluid mechanics for certain calculations and code.
*   **Potential Tasks**
    *   The analysis can thus highlight the value in which you may have experiences with fluid simulation! Not Complete still understanding bousinesqbuoyancyfoam

### 7. dynamic_CSTR:

*   **Description:** Analysis of CSTR with emphasis on changes and how those impact its operation.
  
### 8. CFD:

*   **Description:** Numerical Simulation of turbulence model (k-epsilon model) in C++ and comparison with 1/7th power law model in python.

### 9. 1D Advection Equation:

* **Description:** Implementation of numerical schemes Upwind and Lax Wendroff to solve Linear Transport Problem for smooth and non-smooth initial conditions. Error Estimates using L2 Norm and Experimental order of convergence is also determined for various mesh resolution. Csv file is generated in cpp code which is accessed by python code for plotting.
